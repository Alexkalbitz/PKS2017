# PKS2017


this can be used to get bar plots from the the latest police crime stats 2017 by country

it requires the matplotlib and the pandas module

it creates a png file of the raw data in descending order 
and one normalised data at population size of 100.000 people

the code is pretty self explanatory but needs some tweaking (save path of the files) if you want to use it yourself
all the sources used are in the code and also in the created plot .png files. 

sadly i didnt save all of my code since i did some of the cleaning of the original excel file in the python console 
i saved the almost completly cleaned data in the .csv i provided. 

dont blindly trust me!
if you plan to use these plots make sure i didnt mess up the data and compare it to the original
